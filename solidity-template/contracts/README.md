what my code does

1. user books tickets
2. all reservations are saved in mapping
3. user has the option to choose what class they want to fly, default is economy
4. user pays, over the top payment is sent back to user, each class has a different price
5. owners can white list users - saved in a mapping
6. a factory function can create multiple instances of AirlineTicketManager only the owner can do this
